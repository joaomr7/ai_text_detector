        "\n",
        "With the arrival of LLMs, one of the most common situations in today's world is people using AI systems, like Chat-GPT, to create text content for them. This content can be used for doing homework, writing an article, creating a portfolio description and thousands of other things.\n",
        "\n",
        "The texts generated by these mechanisms are pretty well written and can convince anyone that the text wasn't written by a machine. That being said, the **objective of this project is to develop a solution that can be able to distinguish whether a text was written by a human or machine.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution will be a classification model, to predict whether a text was written by a human or a machine and the final product will be a web application that will run at streamlit cloud, where anyone can access this tool.\n",

        "## **Methodology**\n",
        "\n",
        "This entire project follows the CRISP-DM methodology. For a better understanding, I'll be dividing this section into three notebooks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Business Understanding** (this notebook)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * In this, the problem is being discussed from a general perspective and the project solution organization is being described.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * At this stage, the available data to train the model will be analyzed for searching for any possible insights and also transforming the text data to the correct format.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Modeling**\n",
        "\n",
        " * Finnally, in this section, the best model possible will be trained to solve our problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Deployment**\n",
        "\n",
        "After the best model tuning is done, I'll be developing the web application with Streamlit and creating the entire pipeline to predicting whether a text was written by a human or a machine."
